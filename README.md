# Titanic Data Analysis & Visualization with Python  

## Overview  
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset from Kaggle and visualizes key trends using **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**. It explores survival rates, fare distributions, passenger demographics, and other insights through various plots.  

## Features & Visualizations  

### **Pandas-Based Plots**  
- **Age Distribution** (Histogram)  
- **Survival Count by Passenger Class** (Stacked Bar Chart)  
- **Fare vs. Age** (Scatter Plot)  

### **Matplotlib-Based Plots**  
- **Survival Rate by Age** (Line Plot)  
- **Survival Rate by Age & Passenger Class** (Subplots: Line & Bar Chart)  
- **Survival Rate by Gender & Class, Passenger Count by Gender & Class** (Subplots: Bar Charts)  

### **Seaborn-Based Plots**  
- **Age Distribution by Gender** (Violin Plot)  
- **Survival Count by Passenger Class** (Count Plot)  
- **Fare Distribution by Passenger Class** (Box Plot)  
- **Feature Correlation Heatmap**  
- **Age vs. Fare by Survival Status** (Swarm Plot)  

## Technologies Used  
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib**: Customizing and displaying plots  
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization  

## Installation  
Ensure you have the required libraries installed:  

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
